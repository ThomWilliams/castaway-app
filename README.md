## Description

Castaway, is a podcasting app designed to make more podcasting more accessible to a growing market. Excluding all other types of media, it's an app exclsuively about podcasting. 

Decluttering the overwhelming choice of many podcasting and streaming apps, Castaway offers a simple yet intuitive design, that ensures picking a podcast has never been easier. 

Discover a podcast from the GENRE you know you're in the mood for. SEARCH for a specific topic that's on your mind. Or keep up to date with the NEWEST & MOST POPULAR podcasts that are currently trending. The app places the focus on these key functionalities to help users spend less time searching, and more time listening. 

Each dyanmically rendered podcast is primed with additonal information including the podcast title, thumbnail, description, publisher, release date and more to help advise your choice. 

Each podcast also has a built-in audio player for immediate listening. 

Once users find the perfect podcast, they can save it to their personal MyPodcast library. 

An exclusive service for subscribers only, just sign up and login and escape to a paradise of podcasting. 

Free-to-use, if users like what they see and hear, there is also the option to 'donate' to the project, as facilitated by the integration of Stripe.

The app has a mobile-first design, built with REACT and enhanced by HTML, Javascript and CSS. 

It features a sleek user interface, with a customised header (featuring the Castwaway logo), and accessible navigation bar, featuring the Search, Donate and My Podcast icons.

Uses a full MERN stack set up, with Apollo Server and graphQL. 

Email validation upon sign-up prevents duplciation of accounts, whereas checks on login also ensure security of user accoutns. 

It has been deployed on Heroku, using AtlasDB.
